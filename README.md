# Release
While it is unlikely that work on Project Multiverse will continue to a full release, there is a non-zero chance it does. If it does, any release will be free for everyone available, and the project will remain open source. Project Multiverse will never release on consoles (i.e. Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox) due to the NDAs involved in releasing them.
